C++ Program to Manage Car, Book, Product, and Bank Account Data

Description
This C++ program demonstrates the use of classes to store and display data for different entities: Car, Book, Product, and Bank Account. It takes input for each entity and then displays the entered information.

Features
-   Uses classes to represent Car, Book, Product, and Bank Account.
-   Takes user input to gather details for each entity.
-   Displays the entered data in a formatted manner.

Code Structure
The code consists of the following classes and files:
-   `Car`: Defines the structure and functions for Car data (company, model, color, fuel average). [cite: 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193]
-   `Book`: Defines the structure and functions for Book data (ISBN, title, author, price). [cite: 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210]
-   `Product`: Defines the structure and functions for Product data (serial, name, price, quantity). [cite: 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174]
-   `BankAcc`: Defines the structure and functions for Bank Account data (account number, holder, type, balance). [cite: 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]
-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function that uses these classes to get and display data. [cite: 175, 176, 177]

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For using string data type.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with their respective .cpp and .h extensions (e.g., car.cpp, car.h, etc.) and use a C++ compiler.
